# Changelog

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- ONNX import module (`skainet-io-onnx`) with pbandk-generated proto surface, loader utilities, and importer that maps ONNX graphs into SKaiNET compute graphs, plus doc and tests.
- CLI tooling: `skainet-onnx-tools` to export ONNX initializers to JSON and `skainet-onnx-detect` CLI to run YOLO detections from ONNX weights.
- YOLOv8 model upgrades: depth/width scaling, decoupled heads with DFL projection, class-name parsing, and detection helpers to align with ONNX exports.
- Image IO module now published with explicit API surface for bitmap <-> tensor conversions across platforms.

### Changed
- BatchNorm now reshapes stats for broadcasting and exercises JVM/native tests; CPU backend implements `sqrt` to support it.

### Dependencies
- Added pbandk runtime 0.16.0 for ONNX protobuf decoding.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-03

### Added
- Recording/tracing pipeline for tensor ops (RecordingExecution/TracingTensorOps) and compute-graph DAG under `sk.ainet.lang.graph`, including tape-to-graph conversion and GraphViz export helpers/tests.
- JSON export proof of concept via new `skainet-compile-json` module with serialization models, `exportJson` CLI, and tiny graph golden fixtures.
- Multiplatform image IO module to convert platform bitmaps <-> tensors and RGB byte arrays; includes macOS implementation fixes.
- Dedicated YOLOv8 model module (`skainet-models:skainet-model-yolo`) with graph assembly, config/pre/post-processing, and missing upsample/concat ops required by the model.
- NN DSL additions: multi-input `Functional` wrapper, new `Upsample2d`/Softmax helpers, scalar DSL builder plus tensor/number operator overloads, and extra tensor view/pprint utilities.

### Changed
- Graph DSL relocated into the lang namespace with refreshed default execution tape/graph context wiring; removed unused integration module scaffolding.
- Removed committed MNIST training assets; rely on download at runtime.
- Added scalar arithmetic support across backends and void ops to match new operator overloads.

### Fixed
- Corrected unsqueeze view handling and data DSL dtype reuse; stabilized tracing/JSON/tape tests.
- Fixed macOS image conversion path and cleaned duplicate files in the new IO/image pipeline.

### Dependencies
- io.ktor client 3.3.3 (from 3.3.2).
- logback-classic 1.5.21 (from 1.5.20).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN/AKN) module and DSL support, including public factory and aliases for direct construction. Introduces `Akn`/`AknConfig` and `createAkn` mirroring DSL defaults.
- Example KAN models and graphs (e.g., Sine function examples and pretrained variant) with tests and Graphviz export.
- Additional NN DSL conveniences around initialization scopes (weights/basis/bias) and activation hooks used by KAN.

### Changed
- Minor API refinements in lang/nn DSL to better align with execution context usage for new KAN modules.

### Fixed
- Stabilized integration tests for KAN modules and examples.

### Performance
- Minor initialization performance tweaks for new modules.

### Docs
- Updated docs and samples to include KAN usage and references.



## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-16

### Added
- Initial support for model code sharing API (model definition, execution, loading). Implements #196, related to #169.
- Batch Normalization layer. Implements #193.
- Forward hooks and simple tape recording for NN. Implements #190, related to #104.
- Common traversal base for modules, with tests; Embedding implementation with dual value types; switched EEmbeddings to DualModule implementation.
- Dropout (initial implementation) and phase support (training/eval) in execution context so modules can behave differently by phase. Related to #5.
- `tril` op (initial version).
- MaxPool op with DSL support; Conv2D DSL support.
- Data API: initial version including MNIST data loader; JSON loading support (renamed loader classes from CSV to JSON) with tests. Implements #180, #181; related to #176, #179.
- GGUF model loading implementation (initial import and working version). Implements #178, #182; related to #176, #177.
- MatMul support in backends.
- Nested data blocks support in DSL (data block returns a tensor); contexts for creating and collecting tensors (returning last or all created tensors).
- JVM Ops using the Java Vector API (initial implementation) and SIMD Vector API acceleration.
- JMH benchmarks (JVM module) and additional benchmarks.
- Sample showing general tensor calculations (e.g., image color transformations).

### Changed
- NN DSL refactored to use `ExecutionContext`; added `ExecutionContext` parameter to `forward` functions.
- Models and data APIs improved; unified tensor value creation in DSL; moved tensor creation context for safer vector/matrix/tensor creation.
- Default CPU compute used for JS target.
- JS and WASM Kotlin targets aligned for library packaging.
- Gradle updated to 9.0.0; Android target namespaces fixed.

### Fixed
- Crash in schema validation task; added Kotlin compiler plugin configuration for expect/actual.
- Activation not applied in Dense layer (fixed).
- JVM target issues; fixed failing JVM tests; added regression tests; stabilized platform matching test (temporarily ignored) and additional general test fixes.
- Miscellaneous build-signing validation added to avoid CI failures.

### Performance
- SIMD/Java Vector API acceleration for JVM backend operations.

### Dependencies
- com.vanniktech.maven.publish: 0.34.0 → 0.35.0.
- io.ktor (android, cio, content-negotiation, core, darwin, js, logging): 3.3.1 → 3.3.2.
- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind: 2.15.2 → 2.20.0 → 2.20.1.

### Build & CI
- GitHub Actions: use Java 22.
- Bump actions/checkout from v4 to v5.
- Add Gradle local caches to .gitignore.
- Preparations for 0.2.0 release and ability to build local Maven version of the upcoming release.

### Docs
- Added hint/reference on normalization layer paper. Related to #192.


## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-31
- Initial public release of SKaiNET 0.1.0.
